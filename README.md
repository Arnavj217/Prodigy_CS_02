This project demonstrates image encryption through pixel manipulation using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The idea behind the project is to modify the RGB values of each pixel in an image using a custom algorithm, effectively scrambling the image to make it unreadable without the correct decryption logic. It showcases the use of libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV for image processing, and applies basic encryption techniques to pixel data for educational and experimental purposes. The Jupyter Notebook format makes the code easy to follow, with step-by-step explanations, visual outputs, and direct interaction with the image files. This project is not a fully-developed application but a functional and educational script for understanding the basics of image data handling, encryption logic, and pixel-level transformations in Python. To use it, simply open the .ipynb file, run the cells, and follow the instructions to upload, encrypt, and optionally decrypt an image.
